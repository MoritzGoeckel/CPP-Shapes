#What is that?
This is a C++ library for 2D geometry, shapes and collision detection. It supports circles, lines, rectangles and vectors. Additionaly it provides a 2D Quadtree implementation.

#What is it good for?
I used this as an exercise to practice OOP C++. You can use it if it is any value for you, but me getting more familiar with C++ was the main purpose of this project.
